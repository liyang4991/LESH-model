This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(rpart)
library(sp)
library(rgdal)


source("Fun_treeall.R")
source("Fun_treeall_map.R")
source("Fun_shap.R")

# Read simulated data
sim_1 <- read.csv("sim_data182uniform.csv")

sim_1             


```


```{r}

formula=y ~ X1 + X2+X3
print(formula)

# Using the GOZH model, traverse all variable combinations
location <- c("X")
t1 <- treeall(formula, data = sim_1, location, 0.02)


# Save the results of GOZH
filename <- paste("GOZH_result_sim.csv", sep = "")
write.table(t1[["all.q"]], file = filename, sep = ",", row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE)

```




```{r}
# read the results of GOZH
df <- read.csv(filename)
rownames(df) <- df$var
df

```

```{r}
# Using the LESH model, get the variable contribution

VARS_LIST <- c("X1", "X2","X3")
shap_values <- Shap_calcute(vars = VARS_LIST, pd_data = df)
result <- data.frame(t(shap_values))
result
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
